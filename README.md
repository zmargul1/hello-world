# hello-world
Brief intro to Github for the R Programming Course

Hello buds and champs of the internet,

Let me introduce myself.

Just wanna start my own business as a hackentrepreneur, training all young people to hack the system.

I like black trumpet mushrooms and a good smooth peanut butter and jelly sandies. Hack on, fellow chumps.
